# Setup

Building the NVBit client requires first building gs_patterns it also requires a recent version of the NVIDIA CUDA libraries.
gsnv_trace has been built and tested with CUDA 12.3.  Please ensure your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH are set accordingly so that nvcc is found.

export PATH=/path/to/cuda-12.3/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/cuda-12.3/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}

## Step 1 - Download NVBit 

NVBit can be downloaded from the following location:  https://github.com/NVlabs/NVBit

#### Tested with version 1.7

https://github.com/NVlabs/NVBit/releases/tag/1.7

#### From the parent directory of the gs_patterns distribution umpack and build the gsnv_trace shared library.

```
# For example for Linux x86_64)

wget https://github.com/NVlabs/NVBit/releases/download/1.7/nvbit-Linux-x86_64-1.7-1.tar.bz2
```

## Step 2 - Build gsnv_trace.so

```
# Make sure you have gcc installed. Tested with gcc 8.5.0 and 11.4.0

tar xvf nvbit-Linux-x86_64-1.7-1.tar.bz2

export NVBIT_DIR=</location/of/nvbit_release/>  # full path

cp -rv gs_patterns/nvbit_tracing/gsnv_trace $NVBIT_DIR/tools/

cd $NVBIT_DIR/tools

# Edit gs_patterns/nvbit_tracing/gsnv_trace/Makefile and ensure: 
a) GSPATTERNS_CORE_INC_PATH is set to the location of the gs_patterns directory, and 
b) GSPATTERNS_CORE_LIB_PATH is set to the location where the gs_patterns_core.so shared library is located.

#Compile tools and test apps. Make sure the gsnv_trace tool compiles. If successful will produced $NVBIT_DIR/tools/gsnv_trace/gsnv_trace.so
make -j
```


*** <b>NOTE</b> *** make sure you gzip the nvbit trace output file before attempting to use with gs_patterns.

## Running gsnv_trace

The gsnv_trace tool will instrument one or more CUDA kernels within a CUDA application and pass the resulting memory traces to the gs_patterns gs_patterns_core library.  
Once the application has completed and all kernels are retired the gs_patterns_core library will begin processing the trace data and automatically generate the pattern outputs and pattern output files.  
This includes the JSON file containing Gather/Scatter Patterns.

###  configuration
gsnv_trace tool can be configured by setting the GSNV_CONFIG_FILE environment variable to a config file.  
The config file should have 1 configuration setting per line.  Configuration settings take the form "<CONFIG_ITEM> <CONFIG_VALUE>" where there is a space between the config item and its value.

The following are a list of configuration items currently supported:

| Configs                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                | possible values                    |

Example:

```
echo "GSNV_LOG_LEVEL 1" > ./gsnv_config.txt
echo "GSNV_TRACE_OUT_FILE trace_file.nvbit.bin" >> ./gsnv_config.txt
echo "GSNV_TARGET_KERNEL SweepUCBxyzKernel" >> ./gsnv_config.txt
echo "GSNV_FILE_PREFIX trace_file" >> ./gsnv_config.txt

export GSNV_CONFIG_FILE=./gsnv_config.txt
```

Additional settings which are supported by NVBit can also be set via additional environment variables.  To see these please visit the NVBit documentation.
Setting covered here are specific to the gsnv_trace tool.

<b>NOTE</b>: It is highly recommended to specify a target kernel using GSNV_TARGET_KERNEL as this allows the tool to be used more efficiently also results in smaller trace files.

### Instrumenting an application

To start instrumenting a CUDA application using gsnv_trace.  The gsnv_trace.so libary previously built will need to be specified using LD_PRELOAD. 

Example:

```
LD_PRELOAD=$NVBIT_DIR/tools/gsnv_trace/gsnv_trace.so <application> <application options>
gzip trace_file.nvbit.bin
```

This will load gsnv_trace.so and then execute the specified application. NVBit will instrument the application using gsnv_trace.so which will call into libgs_patterns_core to write out the resulting trace file and generate memory patterns withn the trace.
The gzip command will compress the resulting trace file for use by gs_patterns in a subsequent run.

### Generating Memory Patterns using an existing trace file.

In the previous section on Instrumenting an application, we used gsnv_trace.so to instrument an application, the resulting trace file was then compressed.
The instrumentation run also generated pattern files. 
If we want to rerun the pattern generation we can do so using the generated (and compressed) trace file without re-instrumenting the application as this is much faster.
To do this we just need to run the gs_pattern binary with the trace file and the "-n " option.  The "-n" option indicates that the trace file is an NVBit trace.  

Example:

```
export GS_PATTERNS_DIR=/path/to/gs_patterns/binary/
$GS_PATTERNS_DIR/gs_patterns <trace_file.nvbit.bin.gz> -n
```

### Important Notes 

This version of gsnv_trace works with NVBit >= 1.7 

Example:

```
export LD_LIBARY_PATH=/path/to/new/cuda/12.3/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=/path/to/new/cuda/12.3/bin:$PATH

# Point to where you built gsnv_trace.so and invoke the application with its command line arguments
LD_PRELOAD=$NVBIT_DIR/tools/gsnv_trace/gsnv_trace.so <application> <application arguments>
gzip trace_file.nvbit.bin
```
